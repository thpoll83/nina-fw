# NINA-W102 firmware fork for ESP32-CAM

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/adafruit/nina-fw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/adafruit/nina-fw)

This is the Adafruit fork of the Arduino NINA-W102 firmware. The original
repository is located at https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw

This firmware uses [Espressif's IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)

The NINA firmware version needs to be updated in four places in this repo:
1. CommandHandler.cpp
1. combine.py
1. Makefile
1. CHANGELOG

## Building

The firmware shipped in Adafruit's products is compiled following these
instructions. These may differ from the instructions included in the
original Arduino firmware repository.

1. [Download the ESP32 toolchain](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain)
2. Extract it and add it to your `PATH`: `export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/toolchain>/bin`
3. Clone **v3.3.1** of the IDF: `git clone --branch v3.3.1 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git`
4. Set the `IDF_PATH` environment variable: `export IDF_PATH=<path/to/idf>`
5. Clone https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera.git to $IDF_PATH/components/esp32-camera 
6. Run `make firmware` to build the firmware (in the directory of this read me)
7. You should have a file named `NINA_W102-x.x.x.bin` in the top directory
8. Use appropriate tools (esptool.py, appropriate pass-through firmware etc)
   to load this binary file onto your board.
    a. If you do not know how to do this, [we have an excellent guide on the Adafruit Learning System for upgrading your ESP32's firmware](https://learn.adafruit.com/upgrading-esp32-firmware)
